# Advent_of_Code-Rust_Solution
Here are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 using Rust
It may not be the most efficient and concise way, because I focused on being as fast as possible.

# My solutions:
You can find the solution for the `x` december in `src/dayx.rs`

## To run it:
1. Connect to you adventofcode account and download your input data
2. Clone this repo
3. In `src/main.rs` update the path variable to fetch the input file
4. In `src/main.rs` update the called function to `dayx_k(path)` with `x` the day and `k`= `a` or `b` (first or second question)
5. Compile and run the code, check that the libraries `log` and `regex` are imported
